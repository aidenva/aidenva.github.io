Like most people, I enjoy listening to music. [Here](https://www.last.fm/user/aidenva) is where you can find my music tendencies. Broadly speaking, I am a pop culture aficionado, easily agitated by my fascination with its relationship with the cultural zeitgeist or the social <em>status quo</em>. Sometimes I treat music as part of a text, its production, lyricism, and orchestration worthy of literary critique; sometimes I enjoy its apparent superficiality.
