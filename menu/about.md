My full name is Lê Mạnh Linh, and the order it goes in English should be Linh Manh Le. I currently work as a Chemical Engineer at an energy startup!

## Education

I spent my K-12 education in Vietnam, mostly at the [Hanoi Amsterdam High School for the Gifted](http://www.hn-ams.edu.vn/en), where I was member of the English 1 (Anh 1) class for my high school. I competed in the National English Academic Competition, organized Ngay Hoi Anh Tai 2015-2016 and Ams Got Talent IX, and was the president of our Model UN team. Check out my most favorite [MUN conference](https://ivmun.org/)!

In 2018 I received admissions from [Yale University](https://yale.edu), and spent my most culturally enhancing education so far studying [Chemical Engineering ABET](https://seas.yale.edu/departments/chemical-and-environmental-engineering) and [Global Affairs](https://jackson.yale.edu/academics/the-global-affairs-major/). I am also member of the [Energy Studies Multidisciplinary Academic Program](https://earth.yale.edu/energy-studies).

Some of the most transformative courses I have had at Yale, with somewhat an order of descending impact, include [Water Quality Control](https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=201903&crn=10995), [First-Year Organic Chemistry](https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=201803&crn=10629), [Approaches to International Development](https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=202001&crn=27688), [Transport Phenomena II](https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=202101&crn=21832), [Foucault and the Sexual Self](https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=202201&crn=23790), and [Neural Networks and Learning Systems](https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=202103&crn=11124).

At Yale, I have had the chance to work with the [Yale International Relations Organization](https://www.yira.org) as the Secretary on its Board of Directors and organizing team member in its various constituent conferences. I danced with [Yale Movement](https://www.youtube.com/c/YaleMovement), served as an Ambassador for the [First-Generation Low-Income Community Initiative](https://fgli.yalecollege.yale.edu/), and mentored in multifarious courses across Mathematics, Economics, Engineering, and Vietnamese departments at the [Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/course-based-peer-tutors).

At some point in the future I will pursue doctoral studies in Materials Science, Chemical Engineering, or Chemistry. For resume or CV requests, please email me.

## Research

### [Kim Group at Yale](http://www.yaleseas.com/jaehongkim/)

I am conducting research on (1) electrochemical nitrate reduction in wastewater treatment and (2) in situ OH radical generation under the supervision of Dr. Reza Nazemi and Professor Jaehong Kim at the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at Yale.

In the past, I was involved with the [National Alliance for Water Innovation](https://www.nawihub.org/). [Here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestengg.1c00282) is a research paper that I co-authored.

### [Zhong Group at Yale](https://zhongpolylab.yale.edu/)

I am conducting research on tacticity control in polymer synthesis using Lewis acids under the supervision of Professor Mingjiang Zhong at the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at Yale.

In the past, I was involved with research on (1) multi-component graft block copolymer as basis for synthesis of polymer compatibilizer and (2) poly-TEMPO applications in energy storage devices.
