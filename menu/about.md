My full name is Lê Mạnh Linh, and the order it goes in English should be Linh Manh Le. I am currently a senior at Yale University, graduating in May 2022.

## Education

I went to high school in Vietnam, mostly at the [Hanoi Amsterdam High School for the Gifted](http://www.hn-ams.edu.vn/en), where I was member of the Hanoi English Team for two years. In 2018 I received admissions from [Yale University](https://yale.edu), and spent my most culturally enhancing education so far studying [Chemical Engineering](https://seas.yale.edu/departments/chemical-and-environmental-engineering) and [Global Affairs](https://jackson.yale.edu/academics/the-global-affairs-major/). At some point in the future I will pursue doctoral studies in Materials Science, Chemical Engineering, or Chemistry.

## Research

### [Kim Group at Yale](http://www.yaleseas.com/jaehongkim/)

I am conducting research on electrochemical nitrate reduction in wastewater treatment under the supervision of Dr. Reza Nazemi and Professor Jaehong Kim at the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at Yale.

In the past, I was involved with the [National Alliance for Water Innovation](https://www.nawihub.org/). [Here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestengg.1c00282) is a research paper that I co-authored.

### [Zhong Group at Yale](https://zhongpolylab.yale.edu/)

I am conducting research on stereospecific tacticity control in polymer synthesis using Lewis acids under the supervision of Professor Mingjiang Zhong at the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at Yale.

In the past, I was involved with research on (1) multi-component graft block copolymer as basis for synthesis of polymer compatibilizer and (2) poly-TEMPO applications in energy storage devices.
