My full name is Lê Mạnh Linh, and the order it goes in English should be Linh Manh Le. I am currently a first-year (G1) Ph.D. student in the Department of Applied Physics at the [Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/), working with Professor Zachary Schiffer on [nitrogen electrochemistry](https://schifferlab.seas.harvard.edu/research/).

## Education

I spent my K-12 education in Vietnam, mostly at the [Hanoi Amsterdam High School for the Gifted](http://www.hn-ams.edu.vn/en), where I was member of the English 1 (Anh 1) class for my high school. I competed in the National English Academic Competition for two years, organized Ngay Hoi Anh Tai 2015-2016 and Ams Got Talent IX, and was the president of our Model UN team. Check out my most favorite [MUN conference](https://ivmun.org/)!

In 2018, I received admissions from [Yale University](https://yale.edu), and spent my most culturally enhancing education so far studying [Chemical Engineering](https://seas.yale.edu/departments/chemical-and-environmental-engineering) and [Global Affairs](https://jackson.yale.edu/academics/the-global-affairs-major/). I was also member of the [Energy Studies Multidisciplinary Academic Program](https://earth.yale.edu/energy-studies).

Some of the most transformative courses I had at Yale, with somewhat a descending order of impact, include [Water Quality Control](https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=201903&crn=10995), [First-Year Organic Chemistry](https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=201803&crn=10629), [Approaches to International Development](https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=202001&crn=27688), [Transport Phenomena II](https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=202101&crn=21832), [Foucault and the Sexual Self](https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=202201&crn=23790), and [Neural Networks and Learning Systems](https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=202103&crn=11124).

At Yale, I had the chance to work with the [Yale International Relations Organization](https://www.yira.org) as the Secretary on its Board of Directors and organizing team member in its various constituent conferences. I danced with [Yale Movement](https://www.youtube.com/c/YaleMovement), served as an Ambassador for the [First-Generation Low-Income Community Initiative](https://fgli.yalecollege.yale.edu/), and mentored in multifarious courses across Mathematics, Economics, Engineering, and Vietnamese departments at the [Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/course-based-peer-tutors).

## Research

### [Kim Group at Yale](http://www.yaleseas.com/jaehongkim/)

I conducted research on (1) electrochemical nitrate reduction in wastewater treatment and (2) in situ OH radical generation under the supervision of Dr. Reza Nazemi and Professor Jaehong Kim at the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at Yale.

I was involved with the [National Alliance for Water Innovation](https://www.nawihub.org/). [Here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestengg.1c00282) is a research paper that I co-authored.

### [Zhong Group at Yale](https://zhongpolylab.yale.edu/)

I conducted research on (1) tacticity control in polymer synthesis using Lewis acids and (2) multi-component graft block copolymer as basis for synthesis of polymer compatibilizer under the supervision of Professor Mingjiang Zhong at the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at Yale.

### [World Health Organization SDG3 Global Action Plan](https://www.who.int/initiatives/sdg3-global-action-plan)

My capstone project in the Global Affairs major allowed me, along with six other graduating seniors, to consult the World Health Organization (WHO) Innovation Hub on its pioneering work within the Sustainable Develop Goal 3 Global Action Plan. Our final report can be found [here](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/global-action-plan/scaling-innovations-to-reach-sdg3-capstone-student-team.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3G4yuLqA3XJ31ffrn7JuOaMkOpmmRdOiRqp6jluij2ZBNPnwlf_ysVTfc), featured on their [2022 Annual Report](https://www.who.int/initiatives/sdg3-global-action-plan/progress-reports/2022?fbclid=IwAR3HnGl5e30LTyPyTho6Iv4DavEzT2Vgt8Y5gNroB_DIyPQ28fsyEPHgTeo).

### [Prometheus Fuels](https://prometheusfuels.com/)

I spent two years in scenic Northern California working in both R&D and manufacturing towards building a large-scale electrolyzer system for sustainable e-fuels synthesis.
