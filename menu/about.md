My full name is Le Manh Linh, and the order it goes in English should be Linh Manh Le. I am currently a senior at Yale University, graduating in May 2022.

### Education

I went to high school in Vietnam, mostly at the [Hanoi Amsterdam High School for the Gifted](http://www.hn-ams.edu.vn/en), where I was member of the Hanoi English Team for two years. In 2018 I received admissions from [Yale University](https://yale.edu), and spent my most culturally enhancing education so far studying [Chemical Engineering](https://seas.yale.edu/departments/chemical-and-environmental-engineering) and [Global Affairs](https://jackson.yale.edu/academics/the-global-affairs-major/). At some point in the future I will pursue doctoral studies in Materials Science, Chemical Engineering, or Chemistry, but I am currently spending my leave from academia working at a startup.
