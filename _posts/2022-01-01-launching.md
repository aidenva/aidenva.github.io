At long last, I managed to put my website up! To minimize the initial effort while maintaining the functionalities I need, this is the visual format that we are working with. The most important features I need are a place to write and a place to update everyone what goes into my resume, and I seem to have accomplished both. Let me know if you can help make this better!
