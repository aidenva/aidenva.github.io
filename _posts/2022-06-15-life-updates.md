I have been on the move constantly for the past few days, and have only got some time to unwind with an intent to write tonight. A lot has changed in my life:

1. I moved away from New Haven! As I finished parts of my research, I felt a relieving sense of tranquility leaving what I would consider my home for all my presence in the United States. It was especially nice to talk with my professors and PhD friends at lengths in these last days, for whom I am still pretty much a student under their tutelage.
2. I "fully" moved into my house in Santa Cruz. I will be sharing my house with a lot of people, but so far I have already welcomed a lot of habitual changes to how I go about my day. I will be back on my bike, and exercise my quads to its capacity climbing uphill from work every day. My room has enough space to support my hoarding tendencies, and that is a new development.
3. I started working. I think it would be a pause from academia and not a full stop, but there are many reasons why this is a decision I embrace. It seems like my initial tasks have already challenged my back, as well as my attitude towards a 9-to-5 schedule. Much as I respect the grindset, I find myself in need of the weekend two hours after lunch everyday. At least my goal to dissociate fulfillment from labor is going well.
4. I am now part of the Apple ecosystem. This is a by-product of joining the workforce, but I am glad I have an extended trial of this experience without any of the price tag. I will stick to Youtube Music though.
5. I am keeping myself accountable for doing skincare twice a day, working out everyday, and radically reducing my carbs intake. The main issue is that, the primary effects of these goals are all obstructed by the free snacks at work. My caffeine dependence might also not be mitigated.
6. I am enrolling in multifarious attempts to go to more concerts. If anyone wants to pay for my flight tickets to Chicago for the Pitchfork Music Festival to see Japanese Breakfast, Mitski, and Cupcakke, I would shed happy tears. Otherwise I will stick in this state (or the Pacific Northwest).

Let me know (for those who know me) what is going on in your life! I cannot respond reliably during my working hours, but I am all ears otherwise.
