I lied a bit about being not overly sentimental. In the past week, as I graduate from college, there were several series of inexplicably tearing up that flowed naturally out of my heart at the end of every night. I wrote at length about how much this place meant for me, so perhaps I should entertain you with a different flavor of introspection. My high school graduation felt very anticlimactic to me. Perhaps it was because I was too preoccupied with the logistics of the graduation ceremony, but I could not shed a single tear or feel anything except relief when I got home. College graduation was powerfully satisfactory because of the lead-up to it, and because of how smooth everything felt on the last day. The procedures felt cohesive; there was a well-intentioned mixture of light-hearted jubilation and heartfelt appreciation. I would like to think that I saved up my feelings for this once-in-a-lifetime climax.

I created a playlist called Yale, which is responsible for the resurgence of several songs here. The theme is everything I felt about graduation: longing for friendship, appreciation of memories, and belief in what is best to come. Every other month I fell in love with 'no tears left to cry', sometimes because of the harmonies, other times because of the thoughts encapsulated in the title itself.
