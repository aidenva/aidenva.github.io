I have been watching Modern Family after getting home from the gym every day, in some way as part of my journey to establish a calming routine. I have been aware of the show much earlier: every year, I seem to pick a TV series for which snippets on Youtube are abundantly entertaining, and watch so much of it I do not really need to watch the actual full-length show. Modern Family is great because their situational comedy contexts are very cohesive with coherent personalities--so no Barney of How I Met Your Mother with erratic, though consistently so, behavior. Some of the episodal plotlines are quite impressive to contextualize.

Yesterday I finished the episode where Gloria and Claire bicker about their roles as co-chairs of the school dance for their own little boys. With confusingly suburban proclivities underlying the tensions before and during the festivities, it took until both retreating to the bathroom for them to resolve whatever qualms they have with each other. For Claire, it is because this is <em>her</em> thing that she has done since her first child: a motif we had seen during the Halloween's episode, and would see again (I really have watched a lot of Youtube clips). For Gloria, it is because she wanted to socialize with the other moms who she felt boxed her as this attractive spouse-stealer and not another mother who just wanted to share their kids' jubilation. An illustrative physical manifestation of this conflict was in the introduction of the janitor, who used to be obsessed with Claire until Gloria showed up.

This is not an atypical situation that the comedy series utilizes. The Pritchett family subsisted on unresolved discomfitures, with sensibilities that seem orthogonal to each other except for that one specific scenario wherein disoriented frustration erupts into acknowledgement of decades-long trauma. An easy psychoanalysis would indicate that these characters have grown up comfortable with the circadian rhythm characteristic of the homogenizing communities they have always grown up with or dreamed of living in. That, or they have established escapist mechanisms to preclude said trauma from ever re-entering their life. For twenty minutes each episode, personal growth is skin-deep. Different pairs of the extended family seek a middle ground to mend their ways; for Claire and Gloria, it did not progress much further than them verbalizing their thoughts and going back to the main event.

In the 2010s, a very common response to character analysis is to claim that the unsettling flaw is exactly the point of the show. Some sitcoms target exceptionally unrelatable personalities; others relish in how portrayal of very commonplace life events help normalize the individual effort to improve themselves, regardless of how minor it is. The viewers are supposed to root for them--the Ted Mosby, Rachel Green, or Nick Miller--as they are not bad people, yet the push and pull of life had positioned them in unique preferences that they could only ameliorate with the companionship they have as adults. They are supposed to be <em>us</em>, people whose sagas have taken many a twist, yet not shaken us to change our faith in the goodness of humanity.

There is some exaggeration with the purported message I am projecting, but I am very unhappy with the popularity of these TV tropes. I do not appreciate the normalization of accepting your story, or merely staring at your flaw and declaring that the world has become too cruel to your tender soul. Take the Gloria/Claire fiasco for example. Claire is so insecure about her social status among middle school boys' moms that she ordered Gloria to climb under the podium covered in dirt to get some chairs, and we are supposed to accept her for who she is? The same episode also continues the arc of Jay deriding Phil and his lack of traditional manliness, and all we get is a "sorry my old man was mean to me so I had to do it to you" after the son-in-law went berserk harassing a mall employee?

In reality, this superficial apololies stem actual personal growth. Save for generational tectonic shifts (think moon-landing for boomers or COVID for zoomers), a lot of adults would benefit from further adolescing instead of saying that they have fully formed their identity and others have to deal with it. The flawed character design might be conducive to narrative convenience, but frequently condones risk-aversion when it comes to personal lifestyle. I am of the camp that people should be more preferrable to change, scientifically experimenting with what different practical moral conducts make them feel. Yet too frequently does popular media take the emotional side of the flawed character while glossing over those who actually has suffered, seeing that they have championed the miseries of their life and thus are ahead of the curve. Oh, poor tender souls that are middle-aged stay-at-home parents knowing by heart the gated neighborhood cul-de-sacs' multigenerational vendettas! Sorry for their covertly racist remarks or environmentally destructive habits, they did not know better.

I love people who aspire. I used to say that I thrive on being uncomfortable with myself, seldom settling for what I currently can do, and struggling to be incomparable. I gush over Kendrick Lamar's journey over the years, realizing the problems that plagued the world only to come back to those that hurt himself. I take corny RuPaul lyrics to heart: "Real is what you feel", "We are all born naked and the rest is drag", or "This is the beginning of the rest of your life." I do not think I have ever been the single success story that can stand head and shoulders above the brilliance of the philosophers I read, the scientists I study, or the stylists I watch. But the commonality among people that dream big is the unwillingness to accept their flaw at the surface level, either turning it into a competitive edge or proactively striving to outshine it. Sometimes these shows highlight how that is possible: Haley coming to terms with how she is much more street-smart than bookish, and leveraging that fact against her own parents. But those moments are interspersed with defensive justifications made in poor taste for want of light-hearted humor, and we sustain a culture uneasy about confronting its own deficiencies.
