In terms of man's emotionality, I tread the fine line between being extremely in tune with my emotions and having high resistance to becoming upset. Going through self-isolation has made me realize that I am not immune to feeling upset; I do contend that my stoicism is greater than that of other people (or at least men). There is part of it that can be attributed to the resilience of living emotionally independently of your parents. The more exciting share of the fact deals with my obsession not to do what is typical behavior. In gender-critical spaces, this is called the act of queering. Growing up I have always observed that it is acceptable for men to be angry but not fragile. I do not seek to be fragile, but I do not consider anger to be prominent in my repertoire of reactions. Maybe I should think more about how conceptions around Zen have also contributed to how I fashion myself.

Spring has flung! This week was themed around my anticipation of Japanese Breakfast, and my god was I satisfied with the band's performances. It is not just the live aspect of it; it is the production value encoded in the complexities of a pop-rock band and Michelle Zauner's liveliness that encodes her joy-seeking journey in the sadness of life experiences. The gong, the gong! I need an explosion of gong sounds every time I listen to music until I recover from watching JBrekkie.
