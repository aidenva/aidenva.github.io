I have migrated across platforms for undirected writing for the fourth time. My first attempt was of course with Wattpad, in sixth grade wwhen I wanted to try out writing fictional short novels. I was also curious about neurological disorders, and wanted to emulate how good writers would allow a protagonist to learn the reality of their condition. My second attempt was with Wordpress. People who I have been fully vulnerable with know what goes on in my Wordpress; much as I do not like to discuss it anymore, I do not think I regret having it public. My third attempt was with Medium, where this music posting was first initiated. In my Wordpress era I had a lot of thoughts to vocalize about musical interpretations of pop culture, and there is some element of guilty pleasure that I partake in keeping this tradition alive.

For continuity purposes I will change to providing some thoughts on how my music reflects my journey throughout the week. I think I have been given a lot of time to relax, work on myself, and explore according to my preferences following weeks of tumult. My music taste has somewhat converged towards the same artists. At the same time, I started to feel like my love for brass and wind instruments have materialized with time.
