Some time this past week marked the six-month anniversary of my move to Santa Cruz, my work, and my workout journey. I think a lot has happened, mostly for the better, especially the chance for me to go home soon for the first time in three years.

What is going on in my mind:
- I have been meeting up with people that I knew in high school, who I only got the chance to reconnect now by association with the Bay Area. I am very thankful for a college experience with scant presence of high school memories, but our lives (certainly mine) have taken so many a twist that I feel ready now to pick up from our bifurcation. For that reason I have been speaking in Vietnamese more often, and I am more flustered with my unnatural tempo of my mother tongue than ever.

- I have had a lot more opportunities to know about anthropologists and Vietnamese studies scholars in the past month as part of my own research fellowship initiative. There are components of Vietnamese formalism that I do not miss, but there are simultaneously a humbling amount of knowledge that I can no longer claim authority over because of my distance, both from Vietnam and from the humanities. Right now I am thinking a lot about public space design in urban studies.

- Different from my summer selection of songs that are upbeat and pompous (dominated by the release of Renaissance), my winter workout playlist is rather sombre. It is bizarre that I feel adrenaline from mid-tempo synth-driven melancholy rhapsodies, but whatever keeps me enthused works. On the other hand, I have been reading a lot about old-school rap scene and engaging with the history of either coast's pre-2000 upheavals. About two years ago I have a similar interest in the Harlem Renaissance, ballroom culture, and drag history. These communities, especially before their commercial prominence, operate with a structure that eludes the power conventions of classical Americana that are truly anthropologically captivating and analytically <em>queer</em>.

- Hearthstone Battlegrounds is getting a bit stale and Mini Motorways has slowly become a less time-consuming favorite. I will get my hands on Pokemon Scarlet/Violet either when a ROM is available or if someone gifts me a Nintendo 3DS.

- I should cut down on social media usage.

- Whenever it gets chilly, I feel like every step I take is consumed with considerations of heat. My housemate lent me her space heater, so when I open my door now there is a gust of cold air that rushes in. I have weaponized this phenomenon as a rationalization for laziness, but hey at least I do not get stuck underneath my blankets all the time. That said, I just cannot love the wintertime sadness.

- I had a very enlightening conversation with a friend about the history of the Model UN community in Vietnam, which was in all honesty the extracurricular activity raised me in high school. Almost all of the people I admire the most from the scene have long ceased associations with MUN, which prompts me to stay that way. It just feels gut-wrenching to see something that has benefited me so much, that I continued to rejoice in in college, be bound to wither away, and not intervene. I hope that the teenage youths of this generation can continue to create their own nourishing spaces with or without the exact same activities that I for once clung to.

- Drawing was never my forte, but I always wanted to match my creative energy with its outputs. When I was younger, I used to sketch outfits inspired by shows I would watch on cable network as if I was a fashion designer, all on one-sided scrap paper that my dad gathered from the discard pile of his office job. I am very blessed to have technology-assisted design (i.e., Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) that both allowed me to stop frustrations with my ungifted hands and provided the fulcrum for my sister and my close friendship. As I lose access to university license to Adobe software, I might try doodling outfit ideas again, now with much more percipience about aesthetics. 

- I will be tuning into the new season of RuPaul's Drag Race--it is always a blast! Their timely reappearance very diligently cures all my seasonal mood swings.

- One of the reasons I have taken great stride in my fitness journey is because of how much I shunned athleticism away from my childhood. For as much as I could recall my dismissal of sports had persisted through primary school when I was hit in the face with a plastic soccer ball, but I remember just not being sure soccer was hailed as the king of sports when I found watching matches to be utterly energy-sapping. In contrary, activities that I enjoyed like competitive jump-roping (my homeroom class was really adamant about being the best), chess (more on this later), or even badminton was considered soft, feminine sports. I felt compelled to excel academically to distinguish myself from physical sports that were so vehemently imposed upon me. It truly took until COVID times when I stayed with a friend's very hale and hearty family that I found working out pleasant, and just generally until moving away from the vestiges of a culturally stifling environment, for lack of a better word, that I could explore the component of my identity that involves my physique. My middle name means strength and my first name can be interpreted as agility; I cannot say I am the best of both yet, but at least I have come round to what my parents originally wanted me to have, even if the journey was replete with self-effacing travails.

If you are ever in the Bay Area, or if you ever want to chat, please do not hesitate to let me know.
