This ten-part series will take the theme of semesters that I have taken classes, and thus gained intellectual capital, from Yale over the course of the last four years. In most cases, classes are foundational to my growth; also in most cases, it is the marginal differences in my own status that allow for a certain retrospective mode of self-anchoring. That sounds awfully contrived, so I will just proceed with what I mean by discussing my first semester, F18.

<h3>CHEM 174: First-Year Organic Chemistry I, by Professor Scott Miller</h3>
Up until the end of my second year, I would always tell people that this was the most impactful course I had had at Yale. Up until now, I would elaborate on the fact that such immense influence was all for the wrong reasons. My journey with CHEM 174 predated the first lecture. In fact lectures were almost inessential to the way I enjoyed the course.

My journey with CHEM 174 started as I was questioning the extent of my 'talent' coming into Yale. When I entered college, I knew I wanted to major in the likes of International Relations, but I also knew that I verbally committed to my parents a judicious attempt at learning biochemistry. My deviation from the 'hard' sciences showcased its first signs in 7th grade when I just gave up on trying to learn hardcore maths, and was a done deal by 9th grade when I had to learn English as a speciality for the high school entrance exam. So at the point of moving to Yale, I was scared. I was scared that, given how much the 99th percentile of science learners in my high school must have sped ahead of me with three years worth of me not learning chemistry, that I must be similarly relatively talentless at a place like Yale.

I think that I was partially correct. What I seek out of a Yale education is in fact the osmotic learning experiences from people who has published in high school, won a gold medal at the International Chemistry Olympiad before taking the AP Chemistry Test, or done both and had also been a first cellist at their state orchestra. I think I was wrong in underestimating my will to parallel such excellence.

I took the placement test to skip the General Chemistry requirement, and to my utmost surprise the test was actually very manageable. This marked my first life-altering experiences at Yale. When I was filling out the paperwork, I marked myself as interested in taking the Physical Chemistry sequence instead. Knowing how much people advocated for the First-Year Organic Chemistry sequence (which I would be ineligible for if I had done PChem first), I thought I had to show up to the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS)'s office to present my case for rectifying my mistake. While in the waiting room mustering up courage, I met David who was trying to take the makeup placement test. Within thirty minutes David showed me his high school junior summer's work at the National Institute of Health on 3D simulation of protein folding, something that he might consider going back to the upcoming summer. This made me realize that I am in fact dipping my toes into the insane circles of Yale academics, inundated with people whose excellence is only diminished by the fact that they have not started college yet. At this point, I was thinking, <em>'why would this guy be even remotely worried?'</em> David is insane for other reasons, but for now I present my case for my first awe-inspiring interaction.

CHEM 174 of F18 was taught by Professor Scott Miller, different from the years before and after us. I had no idea what to expect, because I had no frame of reference. Professor Miller turned out to be one of the most unhinged educators I studied under. He would introduce the definition of chirality by presenting on a paper about a synthetic pathway for a macromolecule by a chemist who happened to (a) just win a Noble prize and (b) be his roommate throughout his undergraduate time at Harvard. Even worse, people were asking him questions. I did not know that we were eligible for questioning this work? I did not know what chirality actually meant yet. Having no frame of reference was the primary decimating factor in my baby steps in education overseas, as I got ahold of my bearings expeditiously the moment my grade for this class arrived.

In CHEM 174, we had three quizzes, three midterms, some weekly homework, and a final exam. There was a solution manual to book problems, so that portion of the grade was just completion-based. The midterms were the scary hurdles to overcome. Before his first exam, Professor Miller told students that if we got a 70%, we would not have to worry about our performance in the class. This proved true at the end, but earning a 77-78% was what you needed for an A instead of an A-. The first exam came and I only had David to prepare with. Our materials were the practice midterm, which I mulled over, and a 20-page cheat sheet that David had, according to him, acquired by spending some shady money in his virtual wallet. (At this point I just accepted that Yale students had moved way ahead of me in terms of what I needed to know about the world, and that is okay.) When grades were back, we were presented with the statistics. The average was slightly below 70, the lowest was in the 40s, and the highest was 99. I got David's exam back before I got mine, and expecting him to be the 99. He got a 70.

I was absolutely floored. For half a day I was sitting on the prospect of having to drop the class, which involved asking around if that is acceptable. I was recounting all my work, seeing how much I should be deducted for each problem that I felt wrong. I thought that I should get about 5-10 points lower than David, which would be kind of okay. <em>I had three more exams to make up</em>, I thought.

I got a 78. My emotions were probably best described by the term cognitive dissonance. I just could not fathom the fact that I was doing somewhat above average in the class. I felt like I was understanding certain things, but not enough by far. I could not fathom how I could have, in this one test, outperformed David, ever. In some strange twists of thought I felt betrayed by the fact that I could be above average in this class.

CHEM 174 was held in Sterling Chemistry Lab, upward the proverbial Science Hill, at 10:35AM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Before Yale, I was always playing the risky game of <em>going to bed at 2AM but telling my parents that I slept at midnight</em>. So when I was suddenly given the lease of life, by which I mean the unbridled liberty to decide my bedtime, I went all out. Joon was also an enabling factor in worsening my bedtime (as I did with Joon's). In my first semester, I could only wake up in time for three breakfasts at most. I was never in the mindset of trying to make it to this class's lectures. If I woke up, opened the shuttle bus app, and saw that there was no reasonable way for me to make it to the bus stop in time and not be late for class, then I would just fall back asleep. My next class was not until 1PM, and it was closer too.

Thanks to David, I started a regime of asking him to ask others if we would have a quiz the next week, and then preemptively made up my mind about sleeping early enough to be in class the next day or not accordingly. The problem sets are posted online, and I could just show up at my section at 7PM on Thursdays to submit my homework. At some point some people in class recognized me as the guy wearing slippers barging into class with 15 minutes left in session. And that was on a good day, when I decided to show up.

I made up for this by trying to teach myself the book materials I was missing out on. As you might expect, on many occasions I found myself grossly underprepared to answer book problems, so I had to scroll up a chapter and spent extra time compensating for my laziness. What you might not expect, and neither did I, was that I was unintentionally getting ahead of everyone. You see, the Chemistry department at Yale has this practice of assigning problems for the content to be covered the week after. A rationalization of this process might be that students show up to class knowing the basis of what will be taught, so the discussions become richer. You might agree or disagree with the approach, but I was just unaware. I only found out by showing up to office hours this one time for problem set 7, and asking some questions about an advanced problem in the question list. The other people in the office hours asked me how I could have known about doing any problem at all if he had not even covered the concepts in class (I think it was learning about Sn2 and E2 reactions). I confessed to not going to class at all, and had a shocking realization that was helping me.

With the help of my Teaching Assistant, I acquired a set of problems to work at home and became fully detached from lectures. I remembered spending pages trying different answers to a six-step cyclization mechanism, googling "stereoisomers exceptions" and learning about allenes, which was in fact a trick question in the third midterm, or using Elliot's petite white board to attempt a graduate-level synthesis question. For Professor Miller, he amped up his teaching techniques by giving exclusively exam questions for first-year Yale Chemistry PhD students on our final exam. But this escalation of insanity, one that would have led people to question the purpose of a Yale education in general if my knowledge came from myself, culminated in one of the hardest-hitting As I had acquired ever: it was my first. It dawned on me just how much I had held in this inquisitive energy from high school years of coasting on my middle school hard work. I found something I actually liked, in a <em>organic</em> way to boot, and I felt extremely refreshed.

After finishing writing about this one class I have found myself to be lacking in energy to continue. I will still float this on my website, but I will come back to detail the rest of my semesters with the following classes.
