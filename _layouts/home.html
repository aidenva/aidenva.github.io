<h1>Welcome to my personal website!</h1>

If you want to know a bit more about my background, check out <a href="https://lemanhlinh.com/about">this autobiography</a>.
<hr>
<h2>Where am I?</h2>

I am currently a resident of Somerville, MA; sometimes I say I am in Boston or Cambridge, both of which I have easy access to. Let me know if you are in the area and want to meet up!<br>

<h2>What am I reading?</h2>

An amalgam of texts I am currently interested in includes:<br>
1. All the articles within this <a href="https://astra-mag.com/articles/blunt-force-ethnic-credibility/">criticism of diasporic literature</a> that has taken Vietnamese community by storm;<br>
2. The lecture notes from <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~shor/435-LN/">this MIT course</a> on quantum mechanics;<br>
3. The idea of <a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1716622/FULLTEXT01.pdf">uncomfortable knowledges</a> in anthropology;<br>
4. More of <a href="https://that-which.com/explaining-foucaults-archeology/?fbclid=IwAR2RcgVo6paKBB_CcnynFY1D4oA6yOGZUIYnl96wCZ0icCaVzWWsHfP3i2I">Foucault</a>, this time on the idea of archeology of knowledge;<br>

We will see how much time I have to engage in personal reading during this first portion of graduate school.<br>
