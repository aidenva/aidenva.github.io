3. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/crying-in-h-mart">Crying in H-Mart</a> by Michelle Zauner;<br>
4. The <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/june-huh-high-school-dropout-wins-the-fields-medal-20220705/">biography</a> of one of the most recent Fields Medal recipients;<br>

<h2>Lyrics of the Week</h2>
Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi<br>
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies<br>
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps then I'm takin' off top five<br>
Take off them fabricated streams, and them microwave memes: It's a real world outside<br>
