<h2>What am I reading?</h2>

Alas, I have become really impatient with reading long-form novels. An amalgam of texts I am currently interested in includes:<br>
1. All the articles within this <a href="https://astra-mag.com/articles/blunt-force-ethnic-credibility/">criticism of diasporic literature</a> that has taken Vietnamese community by storm;<br>
2. This <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00420980221106340">paper</a> on territorial stigma vis-Ã -vis social mobility;<br>
3. Playing this <a href="https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/">game</a> about natural numbers operations.<br>

<h2>Lyrics of the Week</h2>
My God, I'm so lonely, so I open the window<br>
To hear sounds of people, to hear sounds of people<br>
Venus, planet of love, was destroyed by global warming<br>
Did its people want too much too? Did its people want too much?
<h5>Nobody <b><em>(Mitski)</em></b></h5>
