Two of my most favorite activities in college are ranking random things and listening to Korean Pop music. While the industry has become rather supersaturated with aspiring groups with slightly different aesthetic variants, debuts mark an emotional milestone for all trainees that were once inspired by the multi-talented cohort of idols that struggled to superstardom. I want to chime in my thoughts with regards to the best ten debut songs, taking into account their musical and lyrical composition, artistic value, innovation among contemporaries, replayability (spoiler alert), and to a lesser extent longevity. I will not be considering subunit debut (e.g., Girls' Generation-TTS), solo debut when the group is currently active (e.g., Kai for EXO), and My main knowledge of K-Pop belongs to the second and third generation, which means that I have a lot less knowledge of the more recent debuts. If you feel like there is a debut song that can rival these ten, let me know (somehow)!

10. [Free Somebody - Luna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpwG8f9nt4s)
I am implicating myself in technical phraseology early on--by the time Luna debuted as a solo artist, f(x) had been earmarked for permanent hiatus, with the last comeback being a full year earlier and only one more song as an SM Station (meaning no promotional materials in conjunction). At this point, Luna has proven herself to be the gifted yet forgotten middle child of SM Entertainment. Auditioning as a dancer yet in possession of a highly skilled vocal prowess (arguably with more support than Taeyeon) from a clasically trained musical family, the twin sister chose the glamorous life of a pop idol. While well-poised within f(x)'s critical success (their second studio album, Pink Tape, was ranked by Billboard as the greatest K-Pop album of the 2010s), f(x)'s experimental techno-music garnered limited commercial success compared to their elders, Girls' Generation. f(x)'s internal crises also struck at the time when SM's next project, Red Velvet, was already in the making. Solo directions were apt, given that one member was a foreign national of a country that South Korea was in a trade war with, another withdrew for personal reason, and one more (out of three remaining) was the sister of Girls' Generation now-estranged 9th member.

Free Somebody feels like a personal project, as it contains the multitudes of aspirations and showcases the unlimited talents that Luna has relentlessly sought to convey. The music video leverages her dancing skills in a hallucinogenic experience, representative of the starting lyrics ("오감의 끝이 몽환에 젖어 / 이 모든 감각 일어나는 그 곳에": "The tips of the five senses are soaked in fantasy / where all these senses are happening"). Luna's voice projects, maintaining a strong grit as she goes up the register along the chorus. Much like f(x)'s pioneering works, Luna's debut track does not feel like it tries catering to a public audience that enjoys a well-defined female trope. Instead, it is her authenticity that shines through the multicolored media of artistic expressions and reminds us of her profound perspectives.

9. [Face - NU'EST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyXy0m-4bvE)
NU'EST made their first official appearance in 2012, at the apex of boy group grunge that Big Bang, BEAST, or at times Super Junior has perfected. To be honest, I was also a severely lovelorn admirer of this batch of boybands. With hair covering one eye (if not both) and bandanas strewn across imported streetwear, they grow in popularity to influence the likes of EXO, BTS, and of course NU'EST. The group entertained moderate success, rising early on in their career yet struggling to break through, even with participation on the Produce series with competition of a much younger age. The group disbanded earlier this year, not without snatching some achievement awards a few months prior.

Inasmuch as the senior groups to NU'EST heavily inspired their style, none really had a debut track at the same level. It seems like the producers behind the group paid attention to the pop-rock-punk intersections that had worked wonders among the Korean/East Asian public, risked it for their new group entrance, and was rewarded. Even the sprinkling of English words in their hooks ("터져 나오는 Jackpot / 누가 뭐라 건 so what": "The bursting out jackpot / no matter what anyone says, so what") conjures up the heart-wrenching ante-elopement teenage love story that is exactly what was all the rage at that time.

8. ELEVEN - I'VE
This is unsurprising to anyone who knows me in real life. I have harped on about how incredible of a song ELEVEN is to a point where I started being associated with the song to several of my friends. There are many reasons for me to enjoy the song. (1) at a time where too many nugu groups (2) simple yet interesting production (3) familiar faces

7. La Vie En Rose - IZ*ONE

6. MAMA - EXO

5. BOOMBAYAH / Whistle - BLACKPINK

4. Replay - SHINee
