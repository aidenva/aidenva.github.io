This week was spent half in physical turmoil as I explored what was wrong with my stomach, and half afloat Myrtle Beach of South Carolina. I still have not fully recovered from whatever it is that plagued my body, nor departed the airport as I wrote this entry. What I have done is concluded my undergraduate academic career on an anticlimactic note. I think that without proper theses to submit, neither of my majors felt like they culminated in something of substance. I found ample intellectual satisfaction in my junior year, yet somehow I have re-discovered the grudge against my assignments. My pause from academia turns out to be an unregrettable decision; I hope my return to it will be one as well.

Closure (or the lack thereof) has impelled me to just have some fun on the beach. This weekend I was surprisingly hard to amuse sonically, but I guess that is not something terrible to bemoan as I seek joy from these last days with Yale friends. The only thing exciting musically this week was that at Spoads, <em>Spanish Galleon Toads</em>, the original 'Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!' was played amid a rather EDM-heavy mix. The ambience was exactly what the modern usage of camp denotes.
