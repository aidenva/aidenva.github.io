For the longest time I gave myself this role of the ambassador for the liberal arts college experience. I think I still am, and I think I still give it as much love. I think its impact on the trajectory of my life is manifold, something I never came close to expecting, and I have only become ever more aware of that fact when I reunited with people I was so similar to prior to college.

But I have also grown more skeptical of my own hindsight, of my infatuation with the notion of Yale, or the academic elite, in all its glory. To be more precise, I have become way more reticent about recommending it as this promise of wonderland that welcomes all the overburdened high-schoolers whose curiosity is stunted by the banality of college applications.
