Sickness is a curse that befalls humanity. Nature is wild; it is a vicious cycle of living species, pathogens and virogens atop, hoping to outlive or out-evolve each other. When I was younger, I was sick more than once per year. We call it a viral infection—I thought the name was just sốt vi-rút, but it was only until I got to college that I realized it was just a placeholder title. It would involve a week of my corporeal being completely deprived of its regular exuberance, concocting the weirdest dreams that recur years later against my will. Today's version is that Yale stops allowing us to self-serve fruits due to a national shortage of watermelons. After finishing this write-up, I will probably hoard some cubes just in case it becomes reality.

This week is a bit unexciting musically. I tried to let the new music of last week simmer in, and also prepare myself on the cusp of editing my Spring playlist. The ethereal bisexual music feels more prominent than usual, although I must say Panorama is a song that haunts me every other month as I remember how much I fell in love with the group after that one song.
