Sickness is truly something that, unless you have it at the moment, you forget how horrible it feels. I have some deadlines to fulfill in the next couple of days, but all I can think of is the likelihood I have stomach worms. When I was young, we have annual 'worm cleansing' that, I suppose, took care of any forms of worms that existed in children's bodies. The ability to just take one dose and get rid of all bodily parasites that you would have no control over their presence is unparalleled. In the spirit of exposing things for what they fundamentally are, while speaking from the perspective of someone who will not have to carry the burden of birth, I think this process is analogous to how the regulation of abortion in general is a glaring instance of the biopolitical control the state designates itself to wield, and that ultimately it should not be anyone's authority to decide if, for something that is using your own prosperity as its life serum, you want to honor its living.

My music for the past week is just Jubilee on repeat. I think the first half is decidedly better-produced than the second, which is something I have observed for some other acclaimed albums as well. That, or I just have very different emotions for the two halves. The first half has more characterizing sounds of instrumental complexity, while the second half has more of a liminal auditory space.
