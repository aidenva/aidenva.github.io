There are no fruits in this story.

I held my cup of water like a glass of whiskey and stared outward to guard my bike. "Are you ready for the check?," the server asked, hand carrying the box of half the pizza I asked to carry home. My mind was somewhere else; it was either adjusting to the recorded jazz so faint I could barely pick up, or the Mattress Firm sign that flickered to the sight of dusk. I handed him my card and packed my bag. I braced myself for the bike home--or rather the hike home over the merciless hills of Santa Cruz. My procedures inside this establishment were pre-programmed: I knew the item price, I figured out the tip, I had practiced my signature since I was ten. Something felt wrong. <em>Why was my writing so light?</em> I perched my elbow on the carton and stared at my fingers, my processing capacity still clouded over the sounds of the Italian restaurant while my eyes fixated upon the pen. Suddenly I dropped. The cap twisted onto the back landed first, but I spared the impact between the tip and the receipt holder. I became very present in the moment: no one perceived what just happened, but I ought to get home.

When asked if cursive should be taught to all students (presumably in the United States), I responded with my usual hyperbolic mannerism. "The three most important subjects in Vietnamese elementary schools are Math, Reading, and writing in cursive," but if I had to pick, handwriting would rank second. Prior to first grade, knowing the alphabet is considered advanced. Being able to write out letters with controlled hand movement feeds into the insatiable quest for giftedness that suffused accomplishment-oriented pedagogy. The progression starts with pencils in first grade, <em>graduating</em> into ink pens before the start of second grade, and ballpoint pens (or any of volition) in sixth grade. Cursive is not a form of writing; it is the only form of writing permitted, of which the additional choice to italicize the typeface is an elective procedure. Writing is [competitive](https://vietnamnet.vn/18-bai-thi-viet-chu-dep-cua-cac-co-giao-khien-dan-mang-suc-soi-483503.html).
