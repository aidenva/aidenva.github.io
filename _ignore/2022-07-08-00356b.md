My relationship with colors started somewhere between third and fourth grade, when I took a strong disinclination towards a Korean Pop group. The circumstancesd were that there was this MTV-like channel called M4Me (short for "Music for Me") that raged through the ranks of Vietnamese youths, and the mechanism for playing music was through sending votes through SMS. Tensions arose when the fandoms of several groups, now all legendary veterans, could not decipher why this one user named <em>caheojunsu</em> (Dolphin Junsu, nickname of a member of Dong Bang Shin Ki) was just sending so many votes back to back for DBSK's songs. It became an easy task, then, to ally against things DBSK stood for, one of which was their flagship color, red. It was even easier, considering that puns like <em>màu đỏ chứng tỏ nhà quê</em> ("red proves rural", analogous to the "red" in American "redneck") were the status quo among elementary school humor.

In the same vein, I aligned myself with my favorite K-Pop group, Big Bang. Theirs was yellow.
