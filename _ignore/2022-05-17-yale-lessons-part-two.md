The first part of these series took way longer than I thought. I owe it to my ability to pick up unimportant details really effectively; perhaps I should work more on the retention of actual valuable information. The saga continues after I had a very enlightening winter break, by which I mean I got to go home and ascertain just how much I missed being on campus within one short stint of returning to where I had lived exclusively.

<h3>ECON 121: Intermediate Microeconomics</h3>
Another proverbial milestone of the Global Affairs major is the completion of Intermediate Microeconomics. At this point of Yale, I have pretty much settled on my preference of Global Affairs over Ethics, Politics, & Economics. Knowing that I will complete a STEM-heavy major (somewhat due to OPT extension policy), I looked to this other major as more of a practically oriented foray into social design questions I have long loved. Even with EP&E, I would still have to complete ECON 121. Picking this class seemed like a sensible choice.

Except it could have been an impermissible choice. At Yale, AP, SAT Subject Test, or IB results do not let you waive any requirements; they sometimes allow you to take a higher-level class. For ECON, everyone is required to follow the exact sequence of Introductory Microeconomics > Intermediate Microeconomics or Introductory Macroeconomics > Intermediate Macroeconomics. These four classes, along with other intro-level ECON classes at Yale, follow a very rigid curve of 1/6 A, 1/3 A-, 1/3 B+, and 1/6 B, especially because they assign people who drop the course to the B-/C tail of the curve to protect those that stuck with the course. This was especially challenging in the Introductory sequence, when tales of people getting 99 and an A- were rumored because the material was not challenging enough and too many people earned extra credits.

I was egged on to try Intermediate Microeconomics by Joon, who at this point was also pilled on the idea that prerequisites at Yale are almost never strictly enforced. I coyly showed up to a 200-person lecture hall, situated in the thematic Whitney Humanities Center that later characterized both Joon's and my second semester, and sat down amid a sea of people whose major could be anywhere between Math to Sociology (or both). I remember coming up to Professor Eva Chalioti and asking if I am even allowed to take the class. She asked me, <em>'Are you confident in math?'</em> I just said yes. She said then I could take it.

It was also fortunate for me that I was not in attendance for the second lecture. Every semester, Yale classes would commence on Wednesdays, but then the Monday classes in the subsequent week would be cancelled. They would then require students and professors to conduct Monday class schedules on that one Friday in the middle, and cancelled Friday classes. However, this Friday in the spring semester is canonically the second day of YMUN conference, for which all Secretariat members would be asked to not attend if they are not penalized for lack of participation (i.e., if these classes are not seminars). Intermediate Microeconomics was not. It also traditionally hosted a weed-out class on its second lecture, where the professor would just dump all the math that there is to learn in the course in one slideshow, to the dismay of at least half the class and prompting at least one-eighth to drop on the spot. I do not know if I would have stayed had I attended this lecture. Many of the faces that I were familiar with in the first lecture did in fact drop.

Intermediate Microeconomics marked one of the first classes that I learned a concept before the course that is supposed to introduce it to me taught me. This time it is the technique of constraint optimization, which Multi brought up after the first midterm. The course could be summarized in terms of applying computation to economics concepts that people would have learned in the intro equivalent, encoding them in formulas like the Slutsky equation. I was not too peeved with the mathematical evolution of the class, but I did not anticipate that the vocal majority of the course would be. In my opinion, Professor Chalioti placed a heavier emphasis on the graphical interpretations of economic solutions. This hypothesis was vindicated when I later tutored for a different Professor, who was way more mathematically rigorous in her problem set.

My work buddy in this class was Brian Cho, who lived on the fifth floor of the C entryway in Vandy in a mixed-gender suite; through Brian I also met Philena, who at this point was an honorary Branford resident. The marginal reduction in course anxiety brought on by having friends taking the same class is no difference here than elsewhere, but the stroke of luck I hit was when we discovered we were the three of the eight people with a perfect score on the first midterm. Not only does this cure me of all the imposterdom I had, but it also created a funny tale between me and Joon when he took the class in the subsequent semester.

The biggest takeaways from ECON 121 were about the optimization problem that could rationalize many individual behavior, the economic arguments related to insurance, and how tiered pricing worked. It was one of the classes that I prided myself on mastering its material the most, and I proceeded to peer tutor for it the most times, until my penultimate semester.

<h3>SOCY 170: Contesting Injustice</h3>
Knowing that I was interested in learning Italian in the summer as part of my language requirements, I was on a sprint to find a suitable Writing credit. I had previously shopped an ENGL 114 seminar, and felt really uncomfortable with the idea of being critiqued for my writing style instead of my content. This is not to say that there is no merit to the former, but I sought feedback that did not so obviously disengage my points from their mechanical delivery. My principle became to take Writing classes from the departments whose fields are also of my practical interest (Political Science, Sociology, even Environmental Science): if a political scientist do not buy my argument, then I am fully convinced to change.

The issue was that this greatly limited the options available to me as a first-year. I was at the bottom of any priority lists for class enrollment, and I was already picky about the course topics to boot. One of my friends recommended me look into a class he took that had an optional writing credit; it turned out the class, "Moral Foundations of Politics", or MoFoPo, was the one I already self-studied on Coursera and even wrote it into my Why Yale essay. But the other option in the PLSC department was Contesting Injustice, and it felt like an acceptable compromise.
