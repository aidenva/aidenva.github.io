Whenever a new musical product drops, I tend to consult the opinions of three main references: Pitchfork, theneedledrop (or Form of Therapy), and Twitter (or Reddit). In that order, the evaluation methodology results in less quantitative forms. Pitchfork averages out their in-house critics' scores, Fantano gives a "light to decent six" to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and social media does not really grade beyond words. My perspective is in agreement with the detachment from reducing music to a number, but also favoring the notion that art can be appraised in terms of its novelty, delivery, construction, or even overall quality in relation to others of its category. A common defence against art criticism is that "art is subjective," that an artistic enterprise can be invaluable to one and of no value to another. I do not contend that this is impossible; however, I think it is best to have a good faith deconstruction of what it means for art to be subjective.
