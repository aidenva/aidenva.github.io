I am nearing my sixth month of working out consistently (i.e., with a detailed plan). There is discernible evidence for positive physical changes: I look more toned, I can lift heavier weights, and cool calisthenics tricks feel easier to accomplish. Fitness coaches would never forget to tell you that your diet and your sleep matter just as much, and I obediently agree. I have been conscious of my food decisions and sleeping roughly eight hours a day, with some ebbs and flows that come with sharing a crowded household.

Some of my friends are really surprised and supportive of these updates. I was never particularly known for my physique; some might even question the fact that I could have functioned properly in college with my previous quotidian indulgences. The biggest element of surprise in these conversations is the fact that my lifestyle improvements are all according to plan. The life I imagined graduating into was of mental stability and devotion to health, and so far nothing has obstructed my progress.

I became very interested in microeconomic theories and their principal conclusions in my senior year.
