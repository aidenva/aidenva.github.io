I am fighting an uphill battle. I become worn out from writing anything after each part, but I am painfully wised up to the reality that the fine print of each semester will fade away the longer I procrastinate. This journey brims with joy, and I do not want to deprive myself of an opportunity to indulge in the long-gone fantasies of myself in New Haven.

Except, this part is one of the two that will not be set in New Haven. A rite of passage for Yale undergrads before COVID hit was to travel abroad in a Yale summer program, most often fully sponsored owing to the generosity of the school. The catalog of programs consists of a third language immersion, a third cultural exchange, and a third regular-degular lecture hall instruction at a prestigious European counterpart in the names of LSE, Oxbridge, et cetera. Vietnamese international students at Yale have traditionally picked the language immersion program, mostly as an extension of the language requirements we already have had to fulfil on campus during the year.

I had a slightly broader strategy. Yale language courses often span 5 levels from L1 to L5, and students are required to take either three levels of a language or up to L5 if they place out of all lower-level courses. The one exception to this rule is if the student had enrolled in a high school whose primary language of instruction was not English. In this case, they can either take one expository English class or two introductory levels of a third language to satisfy their language requirements. I have discussed a bit about my distaste for writing grading that de-emphasizes the rigor of the content, but I was also aware of how intense most language courses at Yale are. L1-L4 classes meet all days of the week and are worth 1.5 times the regular number of credits for its hefty workload; they also never have meeting times later than noon. The only way for me to avoid taking language classes during the school year lies in the single summer program that teaches L1 and L2 (and a Humanities class on top) Italian. It would make my choices during the school year a lot simpler, my choices for my first summer a lot simpler, and my potential stories to tell family and friends a lot richer.

<h3>Journey from the West, to the West</h3>

The story is structured roughly by my arrival at and departure from the Italian Peninsula, but I think the preparatory work is the most ludicrous component. I got my acceptance into the program by late February, knowing that I should plan to get my Italian (Schengen) visa ready to go. The original plan was to while away a bit in the States for the two weeks between the end of the semester and the start of the program, fly from JFK to Rome on <em>May 24</em>, and rest adequately for the first day of classes on <em>May 26</em>. I reserved at an appointment with the Italian consulate in New York for <em>April 30</em>, asking my friend Nathan who went to NYU to host me in case I had free time and wanted to have fun in New York for a bit.
