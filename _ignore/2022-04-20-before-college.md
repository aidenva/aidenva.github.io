I had a very lengthy conversation with an incoming first-year from my high school yesterday. It is really easy to become nervous about preparing for college; the sheer presence of emotionality in this process is actually adorable. When I received my admissions to colleges, I was extremely jaded. For a month I was unsure if I should feel happy or feel guilty, but that is a story for another time. The story of today is that moving from high school to college is an immense trans-cultural experience, of which the logistical challenges are interwoven with the ideological transitions that are entirely unforeseeable. Let us walk through some of both.

- live with roommates
- clubs
3. Academic orienting
4. Organizing the self
5. Psychology of happiness
6. To Infinity and Beyond
- aspire for more
