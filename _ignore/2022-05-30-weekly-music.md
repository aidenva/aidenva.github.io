Last semester, I partook into this survey to help improve the understanding the mental health of students on campus. One particular question that I was always stuck with was whether I felt the wind blowing on my face today, or the smell of nature around me. Everytime I encountered the question, I was always left a bit stumped. I would promise myself to do that the following day, but the daily tasks that plagued my mind were just too constant for me to remember. On the day of graduation, however, I suddenly felt no urge to accomplish anything. I told people that I started operating with half the speed I normally passed my day with, processing the seconds that passed by and the sensory impulses that were associated with them. That was when I realized what it meant to feel the world around me, with tranquility and self-respect.

I started liking the song Animal by Kesha early in my high school, embarassingly after watching the opening of VSFS that year at my friend's house as he was leaving for Singapore. The song lyrics contains many a platitude, but it benefited from sounding raw and not preachy. Animal used to be the default song in every playlist of mine, until I repeated it to boredom; rediscovery could not have come at a more opportune time.
