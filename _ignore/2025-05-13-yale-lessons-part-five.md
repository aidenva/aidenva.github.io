For most people in school at the time, this semester started deceptively calm yet harbored one of the most pivotal events in the trajectory of their personal lives thus far: the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the people I knew, Annie was the only exception, in the sense that she was following news in Taiwan and China closely enough to know that something big was going to happen. I was not keeping abreast of news beyond the New Haven-Yale bubble. I should have known better, given that I was given a taste of canceling events due to COVID-19 before most people at Yale did. But I am getting ahead of myself.

<h3>GLBL 225: Approaches to International Development</h3>

This semeester marks the beginning of my journey as an official member of the Global Affairs class of 2022. To be fair, you could be accepted and choose not to partake. The academic commitments you make this semester would strongly signal to your peers whether you decide to persevere with the major. This class is one of them.

I call this class "Development" for short. Historically, the Global Affairs was constructed in two parallel "tracks" that students need to choose: either "Development" or "Security". This class is a vestige of the now phased-out "tracks" requirements, though I am sure that students were always required to take both. At this point, this class seems to have a high-variance reputation. Someone in the class of 2020 called it disastrous. Many people in the class of 2021 was obsessed with it. I could not tell how the same instructor could have drawn such contradistinctive responses.

The lecturer in question is Professor Robert Jensen, whose primary appointment was in the School of Management. He has a short stature, but the verbal dexterity of a debate kid turned business professor. The Global Affairs student population also meant that a lot of us had known each other, through YIRA or not. I must have known at least half of the class.

If I had to choose between development and security, there was never a doubt that I would pick development. I had grown very wary of the International Relations school of theorizing diplomacy, especially as the term security is often in relation to proximity to war, capacity for defence, and different methods to obtain power that are pseudonyms for colonial projects. I think development is much harder, because it involves no overt force. Good development, often termed sustainable or inclusive, cannot be imposed and often require well-constructed intent. It also involves much broader criteria, rather than the offense/defense paradigm.

I was thus very open-minded to whether the way I had subconsciously glorified development would pan out the way I had hoped. Professor Jensen, again a quirky charismatic man, took us on a long-hauled tour of what it meant to be poor. We first discussed the difference between transient poverty and chronic poverty, what psychological and economic behavior might differ for families in the two category, and how a surveying agency can tabulate the poverty levels of a community. After digging into how to report a meaningfully comparable figure of effective household income, we talked about inequality, insurance, and the moral hazards associated with forms of social interventions. The concepts follow a pretty logical narrative order, but I am sure that "inequality" can be a class by itself. This is all before the midterm, which will henceforth be my way of saying before the pandemic-induced lockdown kicked in.

I am very impressed with professors who cover a wide base without making it feel gnarly. Last semester's Water Quality was one, and this was another. If anything, this class did a wonderful job letting the students develop their own research questions, guided by specific suggestions of the lecturer. <em>Yes, it makes sense that there are economies of scale with having more household members, so we cannot simply compare headcount-averaged expenditures between households.</em> More importantly, I like how the thinking behind the instruments of social intervention can be quite <em>first-principles</em>. I still find the idea that marriage between two geographically distanced families was a form of insurance in a predominantly agricultural society to be an intuitive way of interpreting hedging risks.

There were supposedly three problem sets for this class, but we only finished one. It involved us fetching a specific dataset, wrangling with the reality of data collection in longitudinal studies, and proposing tweaks to common models of quantifying poverty. It was a two-week assignment that I was so excited to finish that I ended up finishing it a week early--something that would never happen elsewhere. The midterm was composed of hypotheticals and rationalizing phenomena while invoking some degree of math. There was this one straightforward problem where we were supposed to conjecture the Gini coefficient and draw the inequality curve for a 100-person village where 50 people have nothing and the other 50 split their wealth. Compared to the other questions, it was a giveaway that I somehow overcomplicated and missed. The professor somehow only took a point off.

The professor's quirkiness was not in his grading psychology, however. For the first five weeks, I was not sensing any peculiarities that would split the reception of his class in half. Then on a Monday he sent an announcement that class would be cancelled as he was sick. On Wednesday, he came back with a saga: he actually had to undergo dialysis because of kidney failure. Fret not, he actually had to do this every year. He was expecting to check into a hospital at some point around springtime, but never managed to predict it before it happened. <em>Why would he have to do this</em>, you might wonder. He told the story of his childhood years being quite athletic, but not tall enough for competitive swimming--his favorite sport. Instead, he turned to cycling. According to him, most cyclists had to train for strength to go uphill, but the downhill leg was hard to strategize. Instead, his compact figure, combined with a certain recklessness that would allow him to brake less often, gave him aerodynamic advantages that edged him out in many competitions. He was on track to be a Olympian-level cyclist had it not been for the one time his failure to break in time proved catastrophic. Not only did the accident rule out possibilities of competing further, but he was left with a bad renal system that meant annual dialysis. Had it not been for the accident, he would have never tried in Economics and become a professor!

This story sounded quite jaw-dropping, but his manner of speech was all too convincing. In later years I would look up and see if he was still teaching the class, or even active in teaching at all.

When we moved to online classes, I was not remotely as attentive to remember what was being taught. I did remember, however, that he spent three lectures talking about his own previous research in development economics. He talked about his field work in rural India, on two separate projects. One of them was about fish pricing before mobile phones, how the information lag between off-shore fishing boats and market sellers created high price variability and excess stock waste. The second project was on how he came to use the diversity of TV shows as a proxy to study gender inequality between North and South India. I will probably not be able to do justice to the work he did, but you can find out about both of these works online. In fact, I came to learn that he is somewhat of an infamous figure in development economics. The first paper is for sure a seminal work in the line of research involving information communication and technology, especially as there was such a strong correlation proven by the study design. Someone called him the [Indiana Jones of economics](https://freakonomics.com/tag/robert-jensen/).

Was the crash course on development successful in convincing me that it was worth studying? I think so. I did not even have a full semester of knowledge and still obsessed over it. I think insurance has a bad reputation in modern America because of well-documented predatory practices. But for Vietnam, a country with many communities still proactively manoeuvring its way out of chronic poverty, insurance is actually doing what it is supposed to do. I remember calling my mom and telling her how I was growing more fascinated with the conceptual and practical considerations of insurance policies by every lecture. She works for the insurance company of the agricultural bank of Vietnam; the team that she manages was in charge of designing low-cost insurance policies for non-marine transport vehicles (so motorbikes or vans) for the mountainous Northwest regions. I used to travel with her on her work trips as she surveyed villages in LÃ o Cai, one of the border provinces, where having gravel roads that cars could even travel on was relatively recent. I do not think she claims the credit for helping communities escape chronic poverty. I think she is proud of the fact that insurance actually helped some of the most marginalized and vulnerable households the way it was intended.

<h3>CHEM 333: Physical Chemistry with Applications in Physical Sciences II</h3>

Switching gears to a much less optimistic tone, this class completely sealed the deal for me not to work in Chemistry. It was made worse by the fact that it was only a required class for specific tracks of majors on campus (such as ABET Chemical Engineering), so there were fewer people in general, including people I knew. While I designed my course schedule at Yale, I had realized that there would be three monumentally challenging classes I had to take, based on past course reviews. This would be my first of the three, so I had picked an otherwise lighter workload.

If the first semester focused on classical thermodynamics, the second semester involved less than a month worth of kinetics while spending most of the time on quantum chemistry. I do not actually remember what kind of kinetics we covered at all, especially given that I was taking a class actually called kinetics. The quantum component started with blackbody radiation, double-slit experiments, ultraviolet crisis, Rayleigh wwavelength, et cetera--almost anything you could think of before introducing a Hamiltonian operator. In fact, I would say that before the midterm, the class was more like a science history course. There
