At some point in  2021, Twitter user Roon (@tszzl), a microcelebrity on the bird app with a sizeable following among venture capitalists/technocapitalist optimists, nonchalantly declared the term "shape rotator", in juxtaposition to the neologism "wordcel". A Vice article here, a WaPo columnist retweet there, and suddenly the discursive propagation of "wordcels vs. shape rotators" became required reading for those committed to understanding the schizoposter community, especially if they were evidenced as pretext for interpretable mainstream commentary. The barrier to entry was lowered when Roon posted [an article on his own substack](https://roonscape.substack.com/p/a-song-of-shapes-and-words), essentially depicting a world dichotomized between verbal intelligence and visuospatial cognition without the burden of subtleties (i.e., they are not mutually exclusive). While shape rotator is easy to understand etymologically, wordcel necessitates acknowledgement of a loose connotation of the word "incel" and the "-cel" suffix that has become normalized online. The article is pretty fun to read, as Roon puts it well, "you need to be open minded for this. Donâ€™t take it too literally."

I am adjacent to this Twitter circle, but Joon is for sure an ingroup purveyor. As soon as our group in Branford was updated on the terminology, a sleuth of hypotheticals ensued. Wordle, the contemporary obsession, leaned rotator; NYT crosswords, the group's contemporary obsession, leaned that way even further. More things that are rotator-core include the chemistry major, canvas painting, and eidetic imaging in navigation. Wordcel examples can be easy to catalogue: your debate kids, your old school rappers, your Barack Obamas. Sometimes you can stretch the boundaries to a communally acceptable level of inclusion: I thought performing well in a biology course is more representative of wordcel behavior, because they require egregious amounts of factoid compartmentalization, elaboration, and regurgitation that optimizing in the wordcel direction is more beneficial in the early stages than its alternative. (This is not an attack on the discipline, but it is not far from why I stray away from bio-related studies in college. I could be totally wrong on this--if someone decides to conduct a controlled experiment on this, let me know so I can chip in twenty bucks.)

You can see how the edge case toleration would gradually allow several extensions to the original line of thought.
