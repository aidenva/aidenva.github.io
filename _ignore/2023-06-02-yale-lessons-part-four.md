For some reason this semester started very abruptly. Sorry, I mean the reason was clear: I arrived on campus the night before classes start, thus missing some registration ceremony that I was fined $50 for my absence. I do not know really why I was late though. I booked my tickets as the return leg of my flight to Vietnam to get my visa, and I probably could have avoided that penalty if I had not been in such an emotional rush to book my flight. For this academic year, I lived in a sextet with all the previous members of Vanderbilt E31, with the addition of Kofi and Corin.
