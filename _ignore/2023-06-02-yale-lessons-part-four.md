For some reason this semester started very abruptly. Sorry, I mean the reason was clear: I arrived on campus the night before classes start, thus missing some registration ceremony that I was fined $50 for my absence. I do not know really why I was late though. I booked my tickets as the return leg of my flight to Vietnam to get my visa, and I probably could have avoided that penalty if I had not been in such an emotional rush to book my flight. For this academic year, I lived in a sextet with all the previous members of Vanderbilt E31, with the addition of Kofi and Corin.

<h3>CENG 377: Water Quality Control</h3>

Water Quality Control was single-handedly the most influential course that I took at Yale, one that almost never happened. I remember having picked out my five courses for the semester, which started at first with Introductory Macroeconomics instead of the Intermediate equivalent. I had got into the seminar-style introductory course, still unsettled by the brutality of the 98-equaling-A-minus curve that the semester prior enforced due to strict grading policies by the department. The instructor, who apparently was very good during the summer, sounded quite harsh when I shopped the class. There were some students who also seemed a bit too eager to answer the most trivial questions, indicating to me a desire to signal intellectual preparedness that I found off-putting. The professor kept insisting that enrolled students needed to have taken or placed out of introductory microeconomics, which was not applicable to me, technically speaking. I decided it was not worth the mental toll to stay in this course. I switched to the Intermediate level, which forced me to swap out Introductory Physics. I did not want to take another Global Affairs elective. But I could perhaps shop a Chemical Engineering elective, albeit designated at at least the junior level.

The first lecture led me down a shadowed corner of the Davies-CEID complex, in a poorly maintained classroom with zero reception. I was so nervous: I was barely toying with the idea of being a Chemical Engineering major. I assumed an interest in geopolitics, reflecting upon the oft-repeated proclamations of the vastness, diversity, and complexity of natural resources Vietnam boasted. To some extent, water had been a thematic inspiration up until then. For IVMUN 2017, I envisioned this pan-conference crisis that pertained to clean water access, maritime disputes, and oceanic resource allocation. I interned for a water civil engineering nonprofit in 11th grade. Water debt in the form of water-intensive product exports was one of the rare lessons I took away from my first-year seminar. I was fascinated with the entwinement of natural resources and socioeconomic developments, which, in my opinion, primarily involved energy, water, and food. Global Affairs at Yale, unfortunately, barely focused on geopolitics; I was then pressured into finding an academic locus that could satisfy both my interest in the hard sciences and an extensive exploration of the water-energy-food nexus. I switched from Molecular Biochemistry & Biophysics to Chemistry, to Geology & Geophysics (now known as Earth & Planetary Sciences), to Environmental Engineering, to Chemical Engineering ABET. The first switch was out of disinterest in the biological sciences; the second, discomfort with the future of being a chemist; the third, an unwillingness to work in the petroleum industry; the fourth, the additional flexibility of the most vague ABET-accredited engineering discipline. I had hoped to immediately join the workforce upon graduation, doing something practical and high-impact. This class felt like a topically apt foray into what I was signing up for, especially as it was the major with the most course requirements at Yale.

CENG 377 required "ENVE 120, or permission from the instructor." The last time I opted for the second prerequisite option was for ECON 121, when Professor Chalioti asked if I was mathematically competent and I gave a half-truth. I was so nervous that, after arriving five minutes early and realizing I knew no one, I walked out and tried to stay in a bathroom stall in the bathroom outside. When I had mustered the courage to go back to the classroom, I saw a grey-haired man with a tall figure washing his hands in the bathroom. <em>This clearly is the Professor.</em> Something must have overtaken me, as I hesitated squeezing behind his back to exit the bathroom.

'Are you Professor Kim?,' I asked.

He turned the faucet off and turned to the side. 'Yes I am,' he said. He was ready to leave the bathroom anyways.

'Is it okay if I take the class if I have not taken the intro class?'

'You might not survive the class if you are not good at Math.' He gestured for us to have this conversation in the hallway.

'I think I will be fine.' 

'Then I am fine with you in the class.'

It took me a while to realize how awkward conversing with strangers about serious matters normally would be. I still felt like an imposter, especially after staking my reputation on my mathematical capabilities once again. I sat on the right side in the second-to-last row, deflecting any and all attention from myself in the event that I had to drop the class out of embarassing incompetence. Professor Kim walked in, his slow gait exuding the unperturbed confidence of an erudite village elder, and passed out the only notes he printed that semester.

Our first two classes were a crash course on wastewater treatment. There was a constant stream of new vocabulary like flocculation or coagulation that describes the technical steps of handling wastewater. The first problem set was issued on the third class, which consists of two theoretical questions and an essay. 'It will start becoming difficult very soon,' professor Kim said to the class, as I sat confused by the 500-word composition on the importance of wastewater treatment. I made friends with Alec, who was the only person seated further away from the professor than I was, who turned out to also be a sophomore. He majored in Environmental Engineering and English, a combination that arguably paralleled my intentions.

As soon as it cost $20 to drop classes, the course picked up in its difficulty. We started learning the chemistry/physics of each step of treatment, not without taking to heart how to set up mass balance and the logic of chemical reactors. The third question on the third problem set required us to apply trapezoidal rule of integral computation, plug-flow reactor mechanism, and non-dimensionalization, in such a convoluted sequence of steps that TA recitations were a must. There I met David, the course TA, then a second-year student in the professor's lab. He would sit on the left corner of the classroom next to his skateboard, legs crossed in camo jeggings, hair pulled back under his snapback, scrolling Reddit on his laptop. He would come into our recitations louring, probably focused on his own research problems, but would instantly switch to a very caring disposition as he explained every detail of every problem in order. Problem set six was the first time I could do more than half of the problems without his help.

By the time of the first midterm, the class had followed the instructions of Professor Kim to a tee. Every lecture, he would introduce new components of each treatment step, and proceed to mathematize their mechanisms with differential equations across six moving black boards. The lectures were somewhat repetitive in its procedures, though Professor Kim would begin and conclude every complete mathematical rationalization with an attempt to make it intuitive; in some cases, they come through humor at the expense of Alec. I skated by that fate for sitting in front of him. Our midterms contained series of multiple choice questions that asked about the treatment steps we learned, except they tested the implications of our mathematical derivations that we barely absorbed. Professor Kim would repeatedly open himself up for lunch so that he might spill some secrets about the exams.

Professor Kim was a fellow of Timothy Dwight College, which earned him free meals in exchange for some service. We got lunch in October in Silliman Dining Hall on a Thursday before class time. At this point, I was already in the finishing stages of preparation for YMUN Korea, hosted on the SNU campus. I told him about my Thanksgiving plan in his hometown, to which he asked if I wanted him to ask his former students who were professors at SNU to welcome me there. He asked me about my childhood in Vietnam, how much I was aware of the overperforming U23 Vietnamese soccer team being coached by a former Korean player, and how he used to have beer and fried chicken by the Han river when he was still in Seoul. He said I should not even worry about the exam, and asked whether I was enjoying the course. It was clear how much he liked talking to students.

Whenever people asked me what my best class at Yale was, I would talk about CENG 377, but I could never talk about what exactly about the course content that warmed my hearts so much. It was the only class that skipping lectures never came up in my mind, a fixture in my Tuesday/Thursday afternoon schedule I would clear all activities to avoid coming late. I had prided myself on my ability to learn better than attending lectures ever could, but there was something different about this course that made it rewarding to come. I felt as if I was not just learning about water quality control, but some epistemology of science or attitude to scholarship that I had yearned for since high school. The night before the first midterm, I studied in our classroom knowing that it most likely was empty. I used the chalkboard to create and solve variants of free-response mathematical questions provided in the practice midterm, relishing in contrived solutions of weirdly shaped reactors. At 11PM, my mom called me on her lunch break. <em>I think I might actually like doing research,</em> I told her. 

Towards the end of the semester, Professor Kim wanted a more interactive classroom environment. He gave mini-lectures about innovations in wastewater treatment, most importantly his master's thesis on desalinating wastewater from kim chi production and his current work with the School of Architecture on solar disinfection in mobile homes. He agreed to host a class in the Silliman courtyard, where he paused teaching about air stripping using Henry's law to ask David to buy everyone Whale Tea boba. He took us to a local treatment facility, where I wore the white puffer jacket that was extremely popular among Koreans that helped him recognize me without even seeing my face. He told everyone to dress up in Halloween costumes if we wanted him to show up in full Darth Vader gear, and he kept his promise. I made more friends: Renee who normally did p-sets at the same pace as me, and Megan who was also a Global Affars major. Recitations became more like class outings in a not-so-secret meeting room on the second floor of 17HLH. I felt like I just walked into my academic safe haven, certain in my desire to be mentored by Professor Kim, David, and this departmnet. I felt at peace.

<h3>CHEM 332: Physical Chemistry with Applications in Physical Sciences I</h3>

The P-Chem sequence was also influential in confirming that I would benefit from not being a Chemistry major. CHEM 332 was the rational next step from finishing organic chemistry. There were maybe ten of us from CHEM 174/175 here, with the majority of the class being juniors. The class met at 9:25AM on Science Hill three times a week.
